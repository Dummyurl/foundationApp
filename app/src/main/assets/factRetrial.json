    "paragraph": " 1 Light and sound is found everywhere. Light and sound waves travel from place to place and can be seen and heard. Light is visible to the human eye and is responsible for the sense of sight. It is a form of energy we can see when it is reflected off the surface of an object. Sound is a mechanical vibration that can pass through solids, liquids, and gases and can usually be identified by the sense of hearing.",
